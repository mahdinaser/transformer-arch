# Discussion on Model Training Strategies and Transfer Learning

## Implications and Advantages of Different Training Scenarios

### 1. If the entire network should be frozen
If all parameters are frozen, the model will not be able to retrain, and the weights will not change when running on the new data.

### 2. If only the transformer backbone should be frozen
This is an ideal scenario because it allows us to retain the weights of the transformer while fine-tuning the model for a specific task. This method makes training faster and more efficient. Additionally, it has the advantage that the model retains its prior knowledge and is not completely overwritten by the new dataset. The weights for the task-specific heads adjust based on the new dataset.

### 3. If only one of the task-specific heads (either for Task A or Task B) should be frozen
In this case, we modify the model’s original knowledge, which can be beneficial if:
- **3.1** We need to retrain the entire model because the new task is significantly different from what the original model was trained on.
- **3.2** We have enough data to retrain all parameters.

Otherwise, this approach is computationally expensive and may cause the model to lose accuracy on general tasks.

## Transfer Learning Approach

### Consider a scenario where transfer learning can be beneficial. The approach includes:

### 1. Choosing a Pre-trained Model
This largely depends on the problem being solved:
- If it is a **classification problem**, I would choose models with an **encoder-only** structure, such as **BERT**.
- If it is for **machine translation**, a model with an **encoder-decoder** structure, such as **T5**, might be a better choice.

### 2 & 3. Freezing/Unfreezing Layers and Rationale
For training, I would:
1. Start by **freezing everything except the task-specific heads**, retrain the model, and evaluate its performance.
2. Gradually **unfreeze layers from the bottom to the top**, retraining at each step.

This process can be time and resource-intensive, but it allows tracking of the model’s performance at each stage and saving intermediate versions while continuing to unfreeze additional layers in subsequent retraining phases.
