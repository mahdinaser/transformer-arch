# Transformer-arch
This script builds a multi-task transformer model using TensorFlow/Keras for:

Sentence Classification (e.g., Tech, Politics, Landmarks, Business Acquisitions).
Named Entity Recognition (NER) (e.g., Person, Location, Organization).
It follows the "Attention Is All You Need" architecture with Multi-Head Attention (Q, K, V) instead of LSTMs. The model is trained using dummy data, includes early stopping, and plots loss trends over epochs. You can run it to see both classification and NER predictions.
